# How to setup Java, JUnit, gradle and Intellij, for Problem Solving
This is a specialized template regarding how to setup Java, JUnit, gradle and Intellij together.
Especially, it is very good for problem solving(PS) as designed to handle multiple pairs of answer/input files.
In PS, answer and input files are proived a pair, to check that your code is written well to solve a problem.
So, it takes long text from input file, your code solve the problem with them,
And then, finally, the code print some result. If result is same with the answer, your code is PASSED.
To do so, System.in and System.out are replaced with InputStream and PrintSteam from a pair of answer and input files.

# Features
  * Debugging with Intellij
  * Run TestCase with a pair of answer and input
  * By using JUnit, running TestCases are done by gradle
  * Debugging and Running TestCases are completely seperated
  * Replacing System.in/out with answer and input files

Good Luck! for your PS
